# Vault Smart Contract System

A simple Ethereum smart contract vault built in Solidity. Users can deposit and withdraw ETH, with secure logic using a custom math library.

## âœ¨ Features
- Deposit and withdraw Ether securely
- Emits events for deposit and withdrawal
- Validates inputs using require()
- Uses a custom library for safe math
- Implements inheritance with a base and derived contract
- Includes `getMyBalance()` for convenience

## ðŸ§± Structure
- `MathLib`: Math library for add/sub with underflow protection
- `VaultBase`: Abstract base contract with balances and events
- `VaultManager`: Full implementation for deposits and withdrawals

## ðŸ§ª How to Test (via Remix)
1. Open [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Create a new file, paste the content of `VaultSystem.sol`
3. Compile with version `^0.8.20`
4. Deploy the `VaultManager` contract
5. Use:
   - `deposit()` (send ETH)
   - `withdraw(amount)`
   - `getMyBalance()` or `getBalance(address)`

## STEP BY STEP:
1. Math Library (MathLib)
We define a custom math library with safe add() and sub() functions.
This library is used in the Vault contracts to avoid overflow/underflow (even though Solidity 0.8+ handles this by default).

2. Base Contract: VaultBase
This contract:
   - Uses the math library.
   - Stores user balances in a mapping.
   - Defines events for deposits and withdrawals.
   - Provides a getter function to check balances.
internal visibility allows the derived contract to access the data.

3. Derived Contract: VaultManager
   - Inherits from VaultBase.
   - deposit() accepts ETH and updates balance.
   - withdraw() checks if user has enough ETH and sends it.
   - Emits events on each action.

## ðŸ“œ Compile the Contract
   1. Go to Solidity Compiler
   2. Select version 0.8.x
   3. Click Compile VaultSystem.sol

## ðŸ“œDeploy the Contract
   1. Go to Deploy & Run Transactions
   2. Environment: JavaScript VM (for local testing)
   3. Contract: Select VaultManager (not VaultBase)
   4. Click Deploy

## ðŸ“œ Test Deposit
   1. In the Deployed Contracts panel:
   2. Expand VaultManager
   3. Under Value, enter e.g., 1 ether
   4. Click deposit()

## âœ… Check that Deposited event appears and balance updates.


## ðŸ“œ Test Withdraw
Call withdraw() with amount in wei (e.g., 1000000000000000000 for 1 ETH).

## âœ… Check balance reduces and Withdrawn event is emitted.


## ðŸ“œ Check getBalance()
Use your address in the getBalance() input.
Aka Copy your wallet address from the ACCOUNT dropdown in Remix (top-right).
