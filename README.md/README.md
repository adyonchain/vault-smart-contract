# Vault Smart Contract System

A simple Ethereum smart contract vault built in Solidity. Users can deposit and withdraw ETH, with secure logic using a custom math library.

## âœ¨ Features
- Deposit and withdraw Ether securely
- Emits events for deposit and withdrawal
- Validates inputs using require()
- Uses a custom library for safe math
- Implements inheritance with a base and derived contract
- Includes `getMyBalance()` for convenience

## ðŸ§± Structure
- `MathLib`: Math library for add/sub with underflow protection
- `VaultBase`: Abstract base contract with balances and events
- `VaultManager`: Full implementation for deposits and withdrawals

## ðŸ§ª How to Test (via Remix)
1. Open [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
